## One-hot encoding

[![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Allow encoding categorical columns with `M` categories into `M-1` columns according to the one-hot scheme.
The order of non-categorical columns is preserved, encoded columns are inserted inplace of the original column.
